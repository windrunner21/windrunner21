## Hello there 👋

My name is [Imran Hajiyev](https://imranhajiyev.netlify.app), I'm a Software Engineer @[OderoPay](https://oderopay.com.tr) and a Founding iOS Engineer @[GridRun](https://gridrun.live). I have a passion for Swift and iOS Development 👨‍💻, as well as really enjoy my current ongoing and expanding expertise in financial technologies 💳. 

I believe that if an engineer can build something that will affect lives even of a small amount of people, they should more than definitely do it! ✅

I take great care, attention to details and architecture when building software as I always try to come up with the best possible solution. 
A number of my personal projects are open-source, hope they can motivate, help or interest people passing by. Trying my best to find free time and contribute to open source projects.

- You might be also interested in a [OderoPay iOS SDK](https://github.com/TokenPayEng/oderopay-ios) that I have wrote at my job. 💳📲
